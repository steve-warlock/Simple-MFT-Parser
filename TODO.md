# TO DO
    - Create the project structure
        -- we have 3 folders -> src (.cpp files), include (.hpp files), build (the binary location), output (the output of the binary)
    - Create a cmake file
        -- set c++ to 20 
        -- delete existing build folder
        -- create output folder
        -- compile all the files from src + headers
        -- catch existing errors
